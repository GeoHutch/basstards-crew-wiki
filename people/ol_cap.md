# The Old Captain

No name has been given to us for this salty sea-dog, because none is needed. Hails from Sarmar.

Is addicted to heroin, due to old injuries from ship raids.

During the first chapter of the Basstards' adventure, Ol' Cap was a passanger on the Unsinkable II, heading from Librehold to his retirement on Sarmar.
