# Intelligence Reports

## Ships spotted
### 2021-06-08, on route from Libretopia to Sarmar
* Draconid cutter, traveling vaguely towards giant kingdom (actual destination unclear). Flew banner indicating royal mission. Traveled without escort. Did not engage.
* Druidic deep sea skiff, traveling to giant kingdom. Head druid mentions local desire to re-open a druidic circle. Try to avoid introducing Ricci again. Spoke, and traded.
* Giant warship, traveling towards draconid kingdoms. Mission unclear. Traded provisions with us.
* Triton fishers. Destitute and near defenseless, were easy to export for a "tithe" but only able to pay in kind. Good fish. Decent folk. Crew regret that interaction.

### 2021-06-14, near Fiesta Isle (in the Giant Kingdom)
* Weekly cutters, crewed by Goliaths, carrying artifacts on unclear provenance
* Camp is guarded by several goliaths and a hill giant

## Economic reports
* We'll need a fence before we get any of these

## Political reports
* We'll probably need a spy network before we get any of these
