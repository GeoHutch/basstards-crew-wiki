# Captain's log, session on 2021-06-14

Having arrived in Sarmar to offload [[ol_cap]], the crew was given an extensive tour by a hospitable native crewmate, [[papa_durrani]].
We drank the complimentary tea. It was adequate.
We also interviewed **Crystal Sinema**, a fence working in the city.
This person's expertise is in working with metals and gemstones, which are decidedly not the fish that we brought.
However, the crew learned a valuable lesson about opsec when interacting with criminals.
Additionally, we learned the location of an archeological expedition in the Giant kingdom, which seemed a more interesting target for our first proper act of piracy than a simple trader.
The crew set out to scout this island, determining the pattern of re-supply shipments are setting out to ambush a ship full of artifacts on the return journey.
