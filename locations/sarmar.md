# Sarmar

Not the chaotic pirate haven of popular imagination, this island city is hidden by a large-scale invisibility spell, has orderly streets, people mostly somewhere between professional and kind, and free tea for all (it's about as good as you might expect).

Many things in the city are named based on God's groan-inducing puns.

Fences for stolen goods in Sarmar are legal and regulated (they're required to wear beards at least 5" long).
Occasional gambling is compulsory.
Drinking indoors is forbidden, but many public parks serve as ourdoor bars (and part community theater venues for the goers).
